## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A free Groq API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pallaviXD/NutriMind-Ai.git
cd NutriMind-Ai
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

```env
JWT_SECRET=any_long_random_string_here
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key_here
```

Getting a Groq API key (free, no credit card):
1. Go to [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up with Google
3. Go to API Keys → Create API Key
4. Copy and paste into `.env`

### 4. Run the app

```bash
# Run both frontend and backend together
npm run dev:all

# Or run separately in two terminals:
npm run server    # backend on :3001
npm run dev       # frontend on :5173
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

## Deployment on Google Cloud Run

### Option 1 — Deploy from source (recommended)

Make sure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated.

```bash
# Set your project
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Deploy directly from source (builds and deploys in one command)
gcloud run deploy nutrimind-ai \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 3001 \
  --set-env-vars "NODE_ENV=production,JWT_SECRET=your_secret,GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key"
```

### Option 2 — Docker build + push

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nutrimind-ai .

# Push to Container Registry
docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nutrimind-ai

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy nutrimind-ai \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nutrimind-ai \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 3001 \
  --set-env-vars "NODE_ENV=production,JWT_SECRET=your_secret,GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key"
```

### Option 3 — Cloud Build (CI/CD)

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml \
  --substitutions _JWT_SECRET=your_secret,_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
```

After deployment, Cloud Run gives you a URL like:
`https://nutrimind-ai-xxxxxxxx-uc.a.run.app`

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Secret key for signing JWT tokens. Use a long random string. |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Yes | Groq API key for Llama 3.3 70B. Get free at console.groq.com |
| `PORT` | No | Server port. Defaults to 3001. Cloud Run sets this automatically. |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | Set to `production` to enable static file serving and CORS for all origins. |
| `CLIENT_URL` | No | Frontend URL for email links. Defaults to http://localhost:5175 |
| `EMAIL_USER` | No | Gmail address for sending emails (optional feature) |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | No | Gmail App Password (optional feature) |

---

## Security

- HTTP security headers via `helmet`
- Rate limiting — 100 requests/15min general, 20 requests/15min on auth routes
- Passwords hashed with `bcryptjs` (12 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiry
- Parameterized SQL queries (no SQL injection)
- Request body size limited to 10kb
- CORS restricted to known origins in development

---

## How the AI Works

All AI runs through the backend — no API keys exposed to the browser.

1. User sends a message in the chat
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/user/chat` with the message + full context (calories, macros, meals, pantry, health profile, chat history)
3. Backend loads the user's profile from the database (age, weight, height, conditions)
4. Builds a detailed system prompt with all context
5. Sends to Groq's Llama 3.3 70B with `response_format: json_object`
6. AI returns structured JSON with message + optional dashboard updates (newCalories, newMacros, newMeals)
7. Frontend updates the dashboard in real time
8. If a meal was logged, it's saved to the `meal_logs` table automatically

The same pattern applies to recipe generation (`/api/user/recipe`) and health advice (`/api/user/health-advice`).
